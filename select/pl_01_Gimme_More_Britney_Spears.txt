It's Britney bitch
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you
Every time they turn
the lights down
Just wanna go
that extra mile for you
Your public display
of affection (Oh-oh-oh)
Feels like no one else
in the room (But you)
We can get down
like there's no one around
We keep on rocking
(We keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking
(We keep on rocking)
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching
(They keep watching)
Keep watching
Feels like the crowd are saying
Gimme gimme (More)

The center of attention
(Do you feel that)
Even when we're up
against the wall
You got me
in a crazy position (Yeah)
If you're on a mission (Uh-huh)
You got my permission (Oh)
We can get down
like there's no one around
We keep on rocking
(Keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking
Rocking (Uh-huh)
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching
(They keep watching)
Keep watching
Feels like the crowd are saying
