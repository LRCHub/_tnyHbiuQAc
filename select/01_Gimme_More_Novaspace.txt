I don't need no diamonds
I got you around
I don't need no presents
Cause your presence is what counts
You can make me happy
If you stay the night
You know what you need to do
To my delight

Gimme more
Come take my heartache away
Gimme more
Let's turn the night into day
Gimme more
More of this magical love
I just can't get enough

Gimme more
Because it's more than just nice
Gimme more
And you will get it back twice
Gimme more
Of this magical love
I just can't get enough

You and me we're born to
Have a real good time
You make me feel so "shalala"
I feel so fine
Just because i have you
Right here by my side
You are my lucky star
