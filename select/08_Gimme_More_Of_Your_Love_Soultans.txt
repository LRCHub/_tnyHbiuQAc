Woah-o-o come on.

Gimme more of your love,
Gimme more everyday, every way,
Gimme more of your love,
I need you to stay, please stay.

I can't believe the way, you're treating me baby,
Everyday, every way,
I don't hear the things that people say, anyway,
Cause I need your love, baby,
Yes I need your love, baby, baby baby.

Gimme more of your love,
Gimme more everyday, every way,
Gimme more of your love,
I need you to stay, please stay,
Gimme just a little bit, baby.
...
I never thought I'd feel the way that I'm feeling,
Anyhow anyway,
We can't pretend there's nothing going on, anyway,
Cause I want your love, baby,
Yes I need your love, baby, baby baby.

Gimme more of your love,
Gimme more everyday, every way,
Gimme more of your love,
I need you to stay, please stay.

Let me say, please don't go,
I'll get down on my knees,
Got me feeling so low, oh baby,
Let me say, need you so,
I want you to know, oh baby, baby.

Gimme more of your love,
Gimme more everyday, every way,
Gimme more of your love,
I need you to stay, please stay.

I never thought I'd feel the way that I'm feeling,
Anyhow anyway,
We can't pretend there's nothing going on, anyway.
...
Oh, oh baby, come on.

Gimme more of your love,
Gimme more everyday, every way,
Gimme more of your love,
I need you to stay, please stay.

Gimme more of your love, your love,
Gimme more.

Gimme more of your love, your love,
Gimme more.

Gimme more of your love, gimme more.

Gimme more of your love, gimme more
